If you’re reading this, it means you’ve come a long way since the pain. I know how much it hurt. I know how hard it was to let go. You gave love with your whole heart, and even if it didn’t last — that was never a mistake.

This heartbreak didn’t break you — it built you. You’re softer, wiser, stronger. And most importantly, you never stopped loving *yourself*. That’s what matters most.

Keep healing. Keep glowing.  
You deserve a love that stays. 💔🌧️`
